# Interview Conclusions

## Problem Validation

The interviews confirmed the existence of the core problem that ReWear is designed to address: users lack awareness of what they own and how often they actually wear it. **80% of interviewees** reported that they periodically discover clothing items they had forgotten they owned, and the vast majority do not track their wearing habits in any structured way.

**90% of potential users** indicated they would be open to using the app, provided that the tracking process is fast and takes no more than 1–3 minutes. Most users would open the app right after getting dressed in the morning, with some expecting to log additional looks during the day if they change outfits.

### If you saw you only wore 56% of your wardrobe, would you pay more attention to how you use your belongings?

Most respondents confirmed that this insight would prompt them to reflect more consciously on their clothing habits. The primary motivations include improving space efficiency, reducing physical and mental clutter, and becoming more intentional about spending. Many stated they would reorganize, donate, sell, or discard items that no longer serve them. A portion of users also reflected on whether certain pieces still fit their lifestyle or personal style, and expressed interest in analyzing the patterns behind their clothing choices in order to make more deliberate decisions going forward.


## Features

### Most Important

- Seeing which items they wear most and least
- See history of there looks
- Getting outfit suggestions generated from their own closet
- The ability to swap or sell items they no longer wear directly in the app
- Sharing outfits with friends and seeing their looks
- Identifying gaps in the wardrobe


### Least Important

- Tracking cost-per-wear (only one respondent selected it)
- Gamification elements such as points or prizes (mentioned by only one person)

### Loggin preference

approximately 40% of users preferred live (real-time) scanning, while roughly half favored taking a photo directly within the app. Given that users also expressed a strong desire to maintain a **photo history of their looks**, the in-app photo approach is the more suitable direction — it supports both logging and archiving in a single action.

## Conclusions

### Must have to add

- **Edit/correction flow for AI scanning** — users are unsure how to fix incorrectly detected items, so a clear edit option after scanning is needed
- **Registration page** — there is no design of that currently.
- **Postponing reminders option** — to avoid winter jacket reminders in the middle of the summer
- **Adding looks later** — for cases when user forgets take a picture on a day they should have option to log tads manually later.
- **Color accents in the UI** — the black-and-white aesthetic was appreciated but a suggestion was made to add colour highlights to key elements for visual emphasis
- **Editing wardrobe** — add new items to the wardrobe / archive old ones. 

### Delete

- **Cost-per-wear tracking** — almost no demand for this feature; adds complexity without clear user value

### Consider

- **Swap/sell functionality** — multiple users requested the ability to sell or swap unworn items from within the app.
- **Social sharing** — a visible demand for sharing outfits with friends.
- **Chatbot assistant** — one user suggested a conversational interface to discuss wardrobe improvements, identifying gaps, getting look suggestions.
- **Customizable tags** — the ability to rename AI-generated labels (replacing "white shirt" with "My cool shirt from Mexico trip")
